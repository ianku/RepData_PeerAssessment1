## Loading and preprocessing the data
#Load the data
```{r loaddata}
library(data.table)
DT <- data.table(read.csv("activity.csv"))
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
total.steps <- tapply(DT$steps, DT$date, FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)
#histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
qplot(total.steps, binwidth=3, xlab="total number of steps taken each day", main="Fig 1")+ geom_histogram(colour="steelblue4", fill="steelblue4")
#mean total number of steps taken per day
mean(total.steps, na.rm=TRUE)
#median total number of steps taken per da
median(total.steps, na.rm=TRUE)
```
Average (Mean) number of steps per day is **9354.23**

The median number of steps per day is **10,395**


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
